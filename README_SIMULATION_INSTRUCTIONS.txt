CONTENTS OF THE ARCHIVE:
1) Locate the "TEAM45_JLR_SUBMISSION.zip" file.
2) Extract from the file to locate 2 archives, "CAD_Model.zip" and "MATLAB_Simulink_Models.zip"
3) "CAD_Model.zip" contains SolidWorks and STEP files, images (PNG) and an MP4 video representing our mechanism.
4) "MATLAB_Simulink_Models.zip" contains our final MATLAB code ("FINAL.m"), our final Simulink/Simscape Model ("Full_model.slx"), PNG images for various plots of parameters measured during the simulation and a video of our simulation depicting the complete charging cycle.

## THIS IS FOR 2022A VERSION OF MATLAB
